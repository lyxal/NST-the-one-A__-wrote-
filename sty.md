# Sty
Sty is a language inspired by [Width](https://github.com/stestoltz/Width) and the set theory. It's a merging between Width and my (failed) [res](https://github.com/A-ee/res).
# Overview
Sty has a much more even instruction distribution than Width; you can except at least 11 aliases per number.

Sty has 10 numbers, and they are as follows:
```
0.~)IGV3q[km
1.!_OHB4w]l,
2.@+PJN5e\;.
3.#Q{KM6ra'/
4.$W}L<7tsz
5.%E|:>8ydx
6.^RA"?9ufc
7.&TSZ`0igv
8.*YDX1-ohb
9.(UFC2=pjn
```

# Paradigm
Sty is declarative. Every Sty program defines how you want the program to work. Internally it uses a stack to parse prefix commands, but that's a different story.

# Plan
```
Set theory based language
Clause 1, the source.
Clause 2, the body,
Clause 3, the filter.

The source always comes first.

Employs Zalgo as well as ASCII.

All codepoints are evenly distributed with instructions.
There are 8 instructions, +0~+8.

Lots of aliases for the same instruction.

So what stuff to take from the set theory?
